                    <h2 class="subheading">The Way of Managing a Hell Lot of Codes</h2>
                    <h5>By: Michael Chen on Feb 24, 2015</h5>
                    <h2>Overall</h2>
                    <p>As a computer science major, I personally use GitHub a lot -- not just for syncronize my personal files, it is probably the best web based server that I have ever used to support a team for a team project.</p>
                    <p>GitHub was founded on February 29, 2008, and almost every programmer/computer science student I know has an account for this website. GitHub is being popular not just because it syncs all your work; as a plus, GitHub keeps track of the changes you made at any time, it also tells you what each member of your group did in a group project. That just make things so much easier when working as a group or when working on my own -- it is always good if we have a recovery point that we can go back to and it’s easy to figure out which part was wrong in the code by using the history function of GitHub.</p>
                    <p>At this point, you may wondering: how does GitHub manage all this amount of codes? Fortunately, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the technologies that have powered GitHub.</p>
                    <h2>Web/Database Servers</h2>
                    <p>GitHub doesn’t have its own data center, instead, they used the server service that was provided by a company called Rackspace. According to a blog posted by the GitHub CTO, they are enjoying the 16 physical machines, 128 physical cores, and 288G RAM of the servers. According to the same blog, their CTO has pointed out that they choose the Rackspace solution based on the following reasons: Price, Flexibility, Capacity, 	Control, Globalization, Cloud and Trust. Instead of other services like the Amazon EC2, Rackspace uses bare metal which provided better IO performance in GitHub’s IO test for the servers.</p>
                    <h2>Search</h2>
                    <p>Since there are millions of people uploading codes to github everyday, GitHub will use a search technology that could match the changing speed of codes. Elasticsearch is the company that provides GitHub this kind of searching service. There is nothing like a specific of the servers running at Elasticsearch, but they do require a server to have 64G RAM, “dozens of CPUs” and SSDs.  </p>
                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>All passwords of GitHub are filtered from all their logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using bcrypt, and login information is always sent over SSL. GitHub also allows users to use two-factor authentication as a security when accessing a GitHub account.</p>
                    <h2>Storage</h2>
                    <p1>GitHub has 2 database (mysql, redis), 18 file server (9 pairs: masters server git data, slaves runs memcache). Those servers used ext3 filesystem for file management.</p1>
                    <h2>OS Choice</h2>
                    <p>Rackspace does provide a variety range of server choices, but GitHub choose to run the server on Ubuntu LTS.</p>
