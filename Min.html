                    <h2>Additive Synthesis</h2>
                    <p> Additive synthesis works by adding together sinusoids to make a sound.  As discussed in class, any sound can be made by adding together sinusoids.  An additive synthesizer attacks sound generation by directly using that idea.  Wikipedia has a very nice article on additive synthesis.
                        On the face of it, this idea seems very easy to implement.  You just specify some way to indicate the amplitude of the fundamental and any required harmonics.  We'll consider a sound definition to be this set of amplitudes.  You program must have some way to specify sound definitions. </p>
                    <h2>Polyphony</h2>
                    <p>Polyphony simply means playing more than one note at a time.  When you strum a guitar, you are playing six notes at a time.  Polyphony means being able to start and stop more than one note at the same time.</p>
                    <h2>Glissando</h2>
                    <p>A glissando means a smooth transition between two notes. </p>
                    <h2>Sound cross-fading</h2>
                    <p>The idea of sound cross-fading is that you generate a single note from more than one set of sound definitions.  You might start with note with sound A, then gradually change to sound B by interpolating between them.  Cross-fading allows for richer sounds, since the sound varies over its period.</p>
                    <h2>Envelope generation</h2>
                    <p>How an instrument starts the sound and sustains it varies, but usually has a volume characteristic to it.  An example, a violin may slowly start the sound of a note or quickly start it for different songs.  This is called an "attack".  Many instruments have a rapid decay after the attack, then sustain at another level, only to gradually decay at the end.  In all cases for a wavetable synthesis component you will need to be able to fade the sound at the end over several milliseconds to avoid a "pop".
                        Wikipedia has a good article on ADSR envelopes.</p>
                    <h2>Vibrato</h2>
                    <p>Vibrato is a musical effect where the frequency of the note is varied repeatedly up and down.  It's a common effect in both voice and instruments.  Wikipedia has a nice page on vibrato. </p>
