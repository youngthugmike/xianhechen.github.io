                    <h2>Subtractive Synthesis</h2>
                    <p>Subtractive synthesis works by starting with waveforms rich in harmonic content and removing harmonics using filtering.  Many early synthesizers, such as the Minimoog, were subtractive synthesis and this remains a common building block for sound synthesis.  Wikipedia has a very nice article on subtractive synthesis.
                        You are required to implement the following waves:
                        <ul>
                            <li>square waves</li>
                            <li>sawtooth waves</li>
                            <li>triangle waves</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        Pulse waves are also included as an option.  You must implement bandwidth limited waves, so create these waves as tables, NOT mathematically.  A simple offline program can generate these waveforms. The method for playing the waves is similar to that of the wavetable synthesis component.
                        Elements of a subtractive sythesizer:</p>
                    <h2>Reson</h2>
                    <p>A Reson is a simple recursive filter that emphasizes a specific frequency.  It's a simple solution for filtering in this application.  A step project will describe the implementation of a Reson.  The instructor can also provide you with additional details for this component.  You should accomplish something approximating the "Moog sound".</p>
                    <h2>Polyphony</h2>
                    <p>Polyphony simply means playing more than one note at a time.  When you strum a guitar, you are playing six notes at a time.  Polyphony means being able to start and stop more than one note at the same time.</p>
                    <h2>Envelope generation</h2>
                    <p>How an instrument starts the sound and sustains it varies, but usually has a volume characteristic to it.  An example, a violin may slowly start the sound of a note or quickly start it for different songs.  This is called an "attack".  Many instruments have a rapid decay after the attack, then sustain at another level, only to gradually decay at the end.  In all cases for a wavetable synthesis component you will need to be able to fade the sound at the end over several milliseconds to avoid a "pop".
                        Wikipedia has a good article on ADSR envelopes and we will discuss them in class.</p>
                    <h2>Filter Envelopes</h2>
                    <p>Interesting filter effects are often created by using the same envelope design used for amplitude envelopes to filter parameters.  Sweeping the filter frequency creates the famous "Moog" sound. </p>
